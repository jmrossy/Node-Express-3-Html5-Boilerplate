#Node Express Server with HTML5 + Hogan Boilerplate
Herein is a simple boilerplate Node.JS project. It's been configured with the following modules
* Express 3 for running the server
* Hogan-Express for it's HTML template engine
* Socket.io for a simple web socket demo
* Mongoose for integration with MongoDB

The contents are partly based on [Robrighter's popular package](https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate), but it's been updated to use express 3 and include the HTML5 Boilerplate package from [initializr.com](http://www.initializr.com/):
* Simple HTML5 templates including index, 404, 500
* Bootstrap 3 CSS
* Jquery 1.10 + Modernizr 2.6
* Humans.txt, robots.txt
